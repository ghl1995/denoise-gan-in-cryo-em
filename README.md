# robust-denoise-gan-in-cryo-em
# This project aims to develop robust cryo em images in generative adversarial networks.
# Dataset includes the simulation data which adding gaussian noise and colorful noise, expeimental data from the EM bank.

#####
robust-GAN.py is the main training file
PGGAN.py is applying pggan skills into the our model
