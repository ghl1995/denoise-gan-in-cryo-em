# denoise-gan-in-cryo-em
# This project aims to denoise cryo em images in generative adversarial networks.
# Dataset includes the simulation data which adding gaussian noise and colorful noise, expeimental data from the EM bank.
# The criterion to determine whether denoising method is good or not is the reconstruction. We use softwares to reconstruct,     so the other goal for this project is to improve the resolution of the known dataset.
